# DevOps Roadshow
This is a DevOps MVP based around an example ASP.NET Core web app. The webapp was generated by `dotnet new mvc`

Please clone this repo with **SSH Keys**, here are some [good instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#platform-windows).

## Development environments
Setup documented below for Windows(Local and Cloud), and Mac/OSX.

### Windows Local 
First install the [latest .NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowscmd) TODO: automate this upgrade

```ps1
cd aspnetapp
# rd obj #to remove cache
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

your app is running on `http://localhost:5000`

Windows / virtualization notes:
- Virtualizaiton still seems young on the Windows platform.
- Windows does not support nested virtualization -- i.e. Docker running on Windows that is already under virtualization.
- Windows Docker containers like `windows/nanoserver` only run on Windows.
- Azure has some support for nested virtualization ("Server2016 with Containers", running on special hardware) but it seems buggy.
- ATM, docker-compose doesn't work on Server2016
- ATM, Server2016 has a bug that prevents connecting to Docker containers on localhost

### OSX Local
On OSX we use a Docker container to run our ASP.Net app.  [Make sure "Docker for Mac" is installed](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#download-docker-for-mac)

```sh
docker build -f Dockerfile.mac -t aspnetapp .
docker run -p 5000:5000 aspnetapp
```

Your app is running on `http://localhost:5000`.  Note that your `Project.cs` must be listening on `http://*:5000/`. 

Debug container build:
```sh
docker ps
docker run -it <container-id> sh
```

### Azure DevTestLabs
After investigation, [Azure DevTestLabs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devtest-lab/) seem like a good product, we can:
- automate creation of DTL VMs with Windows or Linux
- automate provisioning of DTL VMs with things like git, VSCode, etc.
- automate shutdown of these VMs at the end of a workday to save money
- DTL VMs can be provisioned on "Server2016 with Containers" for potential future Dockering
- Users connect to DTL VMs via RDP
- There is VSTS/DTL integration that I didn't investigate

A rough estimate puts cost of this service at **$50/developer/month**.
Leaving DTL notes here. We are not using DTL right now -- it doesn't give us better virtualization and they cost money.

## Staging environments

We plan to highlight a couple options for cloud-based staging environments.

### Cloud.gov
[Cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov) is Platform as a Service(PaaS) running on AWS and operated by 18F.  It can run .NET Core appliations.
Unfortunately cloud.gov only services federal customers right now. We use it as a free stand-in for other PaaS choices.

First, [Get a cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/accounts/) account and [Set up the CLI](https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/setup/)

```
# Set up
cf login -a api.fr.cloud.gov --sso
cf target -o sandbox-gsa -s clinton.troxel

# Deploy
cd  aspnetapp
cf push aspnet-clint

# Get more information
cf apps
cf logs aspnet-clint --recent
open https://aspnet-clint.app.cloud.gov
```

Note: with default setup, we need to comment out `//.UseUrls("http://*:5000/")` in order for this app to run under cloud.gov.  This setting was added to support Docker.
