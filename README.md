#Introduction 
This repository tracks assets of the minimum viable product for a DevOps continuous integration, continuous deployment pipeline for the [Alaska DHSS modernization project](https://github.com/18F/acq-alaska-dhss-modernization).  This project aims to transform the way Alaska approaches implementation and support activities for its mission critical technology products by taking deeper ownership of the product definition and the foundational processes and tools used in exchange for steeply reduced financial and functional risks of traditional, monolithic approaches.

We believe that DevOps capabilities must support:
1.  Rapid onboarding of vendors and other project contributors
2.  Consistent, prescribed development and continuous integration processes
3.  Measured and minimum standard code quality via automated and enforced unit test and code coverage standards
4.  Rapid feedback via automated, continuous delivery functions
5.  Modern change capabilities that meet the demands of the ever changing business and technology landscape 

#Getting Started

2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

#Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

#Contribute
TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better.
