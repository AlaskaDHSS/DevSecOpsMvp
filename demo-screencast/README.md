# Demo Video

To further our idea of a DevOps "road show" we'll record a screencast that tracks a change from starting work to deployment in a staging environment.

Included:
-  VSTS product backlog item
-  Git branch
-  code change
-  CI build (based on push, Pre-PR)
-  CI Veracode scan
-  PR
-  PR Review, with branch policy
-  PR merge
-  CI/CD to staging app slot


We'll loosely follow a [Script](./Script.md)

The finished video lives in this directory: [change-management-screencast.mp4](./change-management-screencast.mp4)
