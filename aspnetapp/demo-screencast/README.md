# Demo Video

To further our idea of a DevOps "road show" we'll record a screencast that tracks a change from starting work to deployment in a staging environment.

Included:
- [x] VSTS product backlog item
- [x] Git branch
- [x] code change
- [x] CI build (based on push, Pre-PR)
- [x] CI Veracode scan
- [x] PR
- [x] PR Review, with branch policy
- [x] PR merge
- [x] CI/CD to staging app slot

We should record the video in a couple different segments for easier editing.

We'll use a [Script](./Script.md)

## Questions

- [ ] What should the change be?  Just a copy change?
- [x] Should we purposefully fail a test when we initially push the feature branch? YES
